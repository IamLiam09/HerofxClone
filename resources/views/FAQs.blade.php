                    How do I enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>The Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) requires you to enter an additional code when signing into your account, adding an extra level of security. The Two-Factor Authentication feature currently supports the use of an authenticator app or an email address as a verification method.

                To add 2FA to your account, follow these steps:
                1. On your HeroFX profile, go to the “Profile” tab.
                2. Click the Enable button under the Two Factor Authentication section.
                3. To find the requested code, download and open up the Google Authenticator app on your phone and tap Begin Setup > Scan Barcode. Once you’ve used your phone to scan the barcode displayed in your browser, click Next in your browser. You will then be prompted to enter the authenticator code that will appear on your phone.</p>

                    How do I cancel a deposit?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Transactions via “crypto” cannot be reverted once a crypto address has been used and the funds have left your exchange wallet.<br>

            <p>If funds are sent from your crypto wallet, they will be credited once they reach the multiple network confirmations. This process can take up to 6 hours and depends on the blockchain network. Once the funds are received, they are instantly and automatically credited to your vault.</p>

                    I have sent funds. Why are they not in my MT4/MT5 account?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>When you deposit funds successfully, they will appear in your wallet. To be able to trade with these funds, you will need to conduct an internal transfer from your wallet to your trading account. Once this step is completed they will be linked to your MT4/MT5 account under the same ID as your trading account.</p>

                    What are my depositing options?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>We currently offer multiple deposit methods including BTC/ ETH/ USDT (ERC-20) For these deposits, select the deposit method and proceed to input the details of your deposit. You will be given a wallet address to which you can send your funds and they will be loaded to your account upon receipt. The minimum deposit in BTC is $20. With ETH/ UDST consider the “gas fees” on the ERC-20 network before using this form of payment to ensure it will go through. We understand these options may be preferred by our clients. However, HeroFX will not be responsible to make up difference of deposits if these options are used.</p>
